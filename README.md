# Evaluate News with Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Introduction
In this project, I have created a tool that allows users to run NLP on articles or blog posts found on other websites. The user input is handled via a form submission and a request is made to the MeaningCloud API to analyse the submitted text. Once the text is processed, criteria such as the polarity, confidence, subjectivity, agreement and irony of the analysed text is returned from the API and displayed to the user, helping them to classify chunks of content.
